    <li>1 (20 ounce) can Goya Pineapple Chunks</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup Goya White Vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Goya Minced Garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Goya Cumin</li>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring 2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add guajillo and pasilla chiles. Reduce
      heat to medium-low and
      simmer until chiles soften, about 10 minutes; transfer to plate. Remove and discard stem and seeds. Meanwhile,
      coarsely chop one onion
      half; reserve remaining half. Strain pineapples; reserve juice and fruit separately.</li>
    <li>Transfer guajillo, pasilla and chipotle chiles, chopped onion half, reserved pineapple juice, vinegar, garlic
      and cumin to bowl of food
      processor. Puree until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer chile mixture to saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring
      chile mixture to a boil;
      cook until paste loses raw onion taste, about 2 minutes. Season with Adobo; cool. In large container with lid, or
      in large ziptop bag,
      combine pork cubes, cooled chile marinade and reserved pineapple chunks; transfer to refrigerator. Marinate at
      least 2 hours, or up to
      24 hours.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Strain pork and pineapples, discarding marinade. Add pork and
      pineapples to skillet.
      Cook in batches until dark golden brown on all sides and cooked through, about 15 minutes; transfer to large
      serving plate.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, finely slice remaining onion half. Transfer sliced onion to bowl with cilantro. Serve pork and
      pineapple mixture in warm
      tortillas. Garnish pork tacos with cilantro, onions and limes.</li>
  </ol>
